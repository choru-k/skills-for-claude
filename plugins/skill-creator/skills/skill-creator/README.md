# skill-creator

A Claude Code skill that guides you through creating effective skills — from SKILL.md frontmatter to workflow design, reference docs, and Python helper scripts. Use it to bootstrap new skills or improve existing ones.

## Usage

Invoke when creating or improving skills:

```
/skill-creator
"Create a new skill for managing Docker containers"
"Update my skill's SKILL.md frontmatter"
"Add a reference doc to my skill"
```

## What It Covers

- **SKILL.md structure** — frontmatter fields, workflow sections, reference linking
- **Skill design patterns** — when to use skills vs hooks vs subagents
- **Python helper scripts** — bundled scripts for skill validation and scaffolding
- **Best practices** — trigger descriptions, tool allowlists, user-invocable config
- **Examples** — Real-world skill patterns
