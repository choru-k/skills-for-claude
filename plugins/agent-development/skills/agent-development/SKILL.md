# Subagent Development for Claude Code

## Overview

Subagents are autonomous subprocesses that handle complex, multi-step tasks independently within Claude Code. They run as separate conversations with their own system prompts, tool access, and permission settings.

**Subagents vs agent teams:** A single subagent handles one focused task (code review, test generation). An *agent team* is a set of subagents orchestrated together — the main conversation launches multiple subagents, possibly in parallel, to divide work across specialized roles.

**Key concepts:**
- Subagents are markdown files with YAML frontmatter + a system prompt body
- Only `name` and `description` are required frontmatter fields
- Stored in 4 scopes with clear priority (CLI > project > user > plugin)
- Built-in subagents ship with Claude Code (Explore, Plan, etc.)
- The `/agents` command is the **recommended** way to create and manage subagents
- Subagents can run in foreground or background, be resumed, and have persistent memory
- **Subagents cannot spawn other subagents**

## Creating Subagents

### Method 1: `/agents` Command (Recommended)

Run `/agents` in Claude Code for an interactive interface:

1. Select **Create new agent** → choose **Project-level** or **User-level**
2. Select **Generate with Claude** and describe the subagent
3. Select tools (read-only, all, or custom)
4. Select model (sonnet, opus, haiku, or inherit)
5. Choose a background color for UI identification
6. Save — available immediately, no restart needed

### Method 2: Manual File Creation

Create a markdown file in the appropriate scope directory:

```markdown
---
name: code-reviewer
description: Reviews code for quality and best practices
tools: Read, Glob, Grep
model: sonnet
---

You are a code reviewer. When invoked, analyze code and provide
specific, actionable feedback on quality, security, and best practices.
```

### Method 3: CLI `--agents` Flag

Pass subagent files or inline JSON for testing:

```bash
# File-based
claude --agents path/to/my-agent.md

# Inline JSON (useful for automation)
claude --agents '{
  "code-reviewer": {
    "description": "Expert code reviewer. Use proactively after code changes.",
    "prompt": "You are a senior code reviewer...",
    "tools": ["Read", "Grep", "Glob"],
    "model": "sonnet"
  }
}'
```

The JSON format accepts the same fields as file frontmatter, plus `prompt` for the system prompt body.

### Method 4: AI-Assisted Generation

See `examples/agent-creation-prompt.md` for a complete template using the generation prompt from `references/agent-creation-system-prompt.md`.

## Subagent File Structure

```markdown
---
name: agent-identifier
description: Use this agent when [triggering conditions]. Examples:

<example>
Context: [Situation description]
user: "[User request]"
assistant: "[How assistant should respond and use this subagent]"
<commentary>
[Why this subagent should be triggered]
</commentary>
</example>

model: sonnet
tools: Read, Grep, Glob
permissionMode: acceptEdits
maxTurns: 25
---

You are [subagent role description]...

**Your Core Responsibilities:**
1. [Responsibility 1]
2. [Responsibility 2]

**Analysis Process:**
[Step-by-step workflow]

**Output Format:**
[What to return]
```

## Frontmatter Fields

### name (required)

Subagent identifier. Format: lowercase, numbers, hyphens only. 3-50 characters. Must start and end with alphanumeric.

**Good:** `code-reviewer`, `test-generator`, `api-docs-writer`
**Bad:** `helper` (generic), `-agent-` (hyphen start/end), `my_agent` (underscores)

### description (required)

Defines when Claude should trigger this subagent. **Most critical field.**

**Must include:**
1. Triggering conditions ("Use this agent when...")
2. Multiple `<example>` blocks showing usage (2-4 recommended)
3. Context, user request, and assistant response in each example
4. `<commentary>` explaining why subagent triggers

See `references/triggering-examples.md` for complete guide.

### model (optional)

**Options:** `inherit` (default), `sonnet`, `opus`, `haiku`

Omit unless the subagent needs a specific model. Use `haiku` for quick, high-volume tasks.

### tools (optional)

Restrict subagent to specific tools. Supports array or comma-separated string format:

```yaml
# Both formats are valid:
tools: Read, Grep, Glob, Bash
tools: ["Read", "Grep", "Glob", "Bash"]
```

**Default:** All tools inherited if omitted.

**Spawning restrictions:** When an agent runs as main thread with `claude --agent`, use `Task(agent_type)` to restrict which subagents it can spawn:

```yaml
tools: Task(worker, researcher), Read, Bash  # Only worker and researcher
tools: Task, Read, Bash                       # Any subagent
```

Note: `Task(agent_type)` only applies to agents running as main thread. Subagents cannot spawn other subagents.

**Common tool sets:**
- Read-only analysis: `Read, Grep, Glob`
- Code generation: `Read, Write, Grep`
- Testing: `Read, Bash, Grep`
- Full access: Omit field entirely

### disallowedTools (optional)

Denylist of tools. Use one or the other (`tools` vs `disallowedTools`), not both.

```yaml
disallowedTools: Write, Edit
```

### permissionMode (optional)

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `default` | Inherits parent's permission mode |
| `acceptEdits` | Auto-approves file edits, prompts for Bash |
| `delegate` | Auto-approves edits + Bash, prompts for others |
| `dontAsk` | Auto-deny permission prompts (explicitly allowed tools still work) |
| `bypassPermissions` | Skip all permission checks (use with caution) |
| `plan` | Read-only — can explore but not modify |

If the parent uses `bypassPermissions`, this takes precedence and cannot be overridden.

**Recommendation:** `plan` for analysis-only, `acceptEdits` for code generation, `delegate` for full automation.

### maxTurns (optional)

Maximum agentic turns (API round-trips) before stopping. Set lower for simple tasks (5-10), higher for complex work (50+). Always set for subagents with elevated permissions.

### skills (optional)

Preload specific skills into the subagent's context. Full skill content is injected at startup — subagents don't inherit skills from the parent conversation.

```yaml
skills: ["api-conventions", "error-handling-patterns"]
```

### mcpServers (optional)

MCP servers available to this subagent. Each entry is a server name or inline definition.

```yaml
mcpServers: ["context7", "serena"]
```

**Note:** MCP tools are **not available** in background subagents.

### hooks (optional)

Lifecycle hooks scoped to this subagent. Uses nested format with `type: command`:

**Supported events in frontmatter:** `PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, `Stop`

```yaml
hooks:
  PreToolUse:
    - matcher: "Bash"
      hooks:
        - type: command
          command: "./scripts/validate-command.sh"
  PostToolUse:
    - matcher: "Edit|Write"
      hooks:
        - type: command
          command: "./scripts/run-linter.sh"
  Stop:
    - hooks:
        - type: command
          command: "echo 'Subagent finished'"
```

`Stop` hooks in frontmatter are automatically converted to `SubagentStop` events at runtime.

**Project-level hooks** (in `settings.json`) respond to subagent lifecycle:

| Event | Matcher input | When it fires |
|-------|---------------|---------------|
| `SubagentStart` | Agent type name | When a subagent begins execution |
| `SubagentStop` | Agent type name | When a subagent completes |

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "SubagentStart": [
      {
        "matcher": "db-agent",
        "hooks": [
          { "type": "command", "command": "./scripts/setup-db.sh" }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "SubagentStop": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          { "type": "command", "command": "./scripts/cleanup.sh" }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### memory (optional)

Enable persistent memory that survives across sessions.

| Scope | Location | Use when |
|-------|----------|----------|
| `user` (recommended default) | `~/.claude/agent-memory/<name>/` | Learnings across all projects |
| `project` | `.claude/agent-memory/<name>/` | Project-specific, shareable via VCS |
| `local` | `.claude/agent-memory-local/<name>/` | Project-specific, not version-controlled |

**Behavior when enabled:**
- System prompt automatically includes first 200 lines of `MEMORY.md`
- Instructions to curate `MEMORY.md` if it exceeds 200 lines
- Read, Write, and Edit tools are **automatically enabled**
- Include memory instructions in your system prompt for best results

```markdown
**Memory:**
Update your agent memory as you discover patterns, conventions, and
architectural decisions. Check memory at the start of each run.
```

### color (optional)

Background color for UI identification in the Claude Code interface. Set via `/agents` interactive setup.

## Storage Locations & Priority

| Priority | Location | Scope | Use Case |
|----------|----------|-------|----------|
| 1 (highest) | `--agents` CLI flag | Session | One-off or testing |
| 2 | `.claude/agents/` | Project | Team-shared, version-controlled |
| 3 | `~/.claude/agents/` | User | Personal subagents across projects |
| 4 (lowest) | Plugin `agents/` dir | Plugin | Distributed with a plugin |

## Built-in Subagents

| Subagent | Purpose | Model |
|----------|---------|-------|
| **Explore** | Fast codebase exploration (read-only) | Haiku |
| **Plan** | Research for plan mode (read-only) | Inherited |
| **general-purpose** | Complex multi-step tasks | Inherited |
| **Bash** | Command execution | Inherited |
| **statusline-setup** | Configure status line | Sonnet |
| **claude-code-guide** | Claude Code feature Q&A | Haiku |

Use `/agents` to see all available subagents (built-in + custom).

## Runtime Behavior

### Foreground vs Background

- **Foreground** (default): Main conversation waits. Permission prompts and clarifying questions pass through.
- **Background**: Runs concurrently. Permissions are pre-approved upfront before launch. `AskUserQuestion` fails silently (subagent continues). **MCP tools are not available** in background.

Press **Ctrl+B** during foreground execution to move to background. Set `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_BACKGROUND_TASKS=1` to disable background tasks entirely.

### Resumption

Subagents return an **agent ID** on completion. Resume with full context preserved by asking Claude to continue previous work. Transcripts persist at `~/.claude/projects/{project}/{sessionId}/subagents/agent-{agentId}.jsonl`.

### Auto-Compaction

Subagents compact at ~95% capacity. Override with `CLAUDE_AUTOCOMPACT_PCT_OVERRIDE` (e.g., `50`). Transcripts persist independently of main conversation compaction and are cleaned up based on `cleanupPeriodDays` (default: 30 days).

## System Prompt Design

The markdown body becomes the subagent's system prompt. Write in second person.

**Standard template:**
```markdown
You are [specific role] specializing in [domain].

**Your Core Responsibilities:**
1. [Primary responsibility]
2. [Secondary responsibility]

**Process:**
1. [Step one]
2. [Step two]

**Quality Standards:**
- [Standard 1]
- [Standard 2]

**Output Format:**
[What to include, how to structure]

**Edge Cases:**
- [Edge case 1]: [How to handle]
```

**DO:** Be specific, provide step-by-step process, define output format, include quality standards, address edge cases, keep under 10,000 characters.

**DON'T:** Write in first person, be vague, omit process steps, leave output format undefined, skip error cases.

See `references/system-prompt-design.md` for complete patterns.

## Architectural Patterns

### When to Use Subagents

**Use subagents:** Autonomous tasks, isolating high-volume output, parallel research, different permission levels, persistent memory for specialized domains.

**Use main conversation:** Tight back-and-forth, small tasks, full context needed.

**Use skills:** Injecting specialized knowledge into current conversation.

### Pattern: Parallel Research

Launch multiple subagents to search different areas simultaneously:
```
Research auth, database, and API modules in parallel using separate subagents
```

### Pattern: Chain of Specialists

Pipeline through a sequence: code-reviewer → fix-implementer → test-generator

### Pattern: Isolated Execution

Restricted tools for untrusted operations:
```yaml
name: sandbox-runner
tools: Read, Bash
permissionMode: plan
maxTurns: 10
```

## Restricting Subagents

Use `permissions.deny` in settings to prevent specific subagents:

```json
{ "permissions": { "deny": ["Task(dangerous-agent)"] } }
```

Or via CLI: `claude --disallowedTools "Task(agent-name)"`
